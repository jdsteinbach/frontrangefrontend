<blockquote><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Moving to Eventbrite, Break till Fall</blockquote>

<p>Hello friends! Hope you&rsquo;ve all been doing well lately. We&rsquo;ve enjoyed connecting over live-streamed talks for the past several months and we hope they&rsquo;ve been helpful to you!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got a few big things to announce for our meetup.</p>

<h2>1) Out with Meetup, in with Eventbrite</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been using Meetup.com for several years here. Unfortunately for us (the organizers), Meetup has no free tier and has steadily raised fees for the last few years. Sure, we could pass that cost along to you as event fees, but we&rsquo;d rather keep this group free. <strong>To keep our events free, we&rsquo;re moving to Eventbrite for future talks.</strong> (Their service is free as long as our events are free to you!) Because our meetup email list has grown so long, we&rsquo;re not going to transfer everyone automatically. <strong>To continue getting updates about our future events, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/o/front-range-front-end-41323271133">follow us on Eventbrite</a></strong>, <a href="https://twitter.com/frontrangefe">follow us on Twitter</a>, or <a href="https://frontrangefrontend.com/#subscribe">subscribe to our email mailing list</a>. Whenever we get back to in-person meetups, Eventbrite will allow us to schedule those too. Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQPfx5WCWViJcm3XVYDXbqw">YouTube channel</a> will still hold the live-streamed and recorded talks you&rsquo;re used to. We've made some changes to our website: you&rsquo;ll find <a href="https://frontrangefrontend.com/#rsvp">upcoming events listed there</a> as well.</p>

<p>This change will be final Feb 19, 2022. Our Eventbrite page is live; Meetup will be shut down on the 19th.</p>

<h2>2) Taking a break till Fall</h2>

<p>The last couple years have been really challenging. For Jason and James, meeting people in-person and sharing some time around the talk was one of the best parts of this meetup. We&rsquo;ve enjoyed live-streaming our talks, but it&rsquo;s not the same without the community interaction. We&rsquo;re also running low on speakers. Over the last year, it&rsquo;s gotten harder to find new talks for you. Additionally, we&rsquo;re feeling some burnout. Some of you are feeling the same. We don&rsquo;t want to make that worse, so <strong>we&rsquo;re going to take a break till Fall 2022</strong>. If you <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/o/front-range-front-end-41323271133">check out our Eventbrite page</a>, you&rsquo;ll notice September is the first scheduled event. As we confirm a speaker and topic, we&rsquo;ll update that event page. As much as we&rsquo;d love to work at getting talks in between now and then, the healthiest thing is to remove the pressure and take time to schedule for fall and beyond.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in giving a talk at one of our events, that&rsquo;s awesome! Please <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfb9b1AwJnMD3Qzfd2aHIf16WHVJnBS58MDwlgk_1DOVGrVWg/viewform">submit your talk</a></strong> here. As we mentioned above, finding speakers is difficult. We&rsquo;d love to hear from our own members!</p>

<p>Thanks so much for hanging with us through these transitions and tough decisions. We really appreciate you and can&rsquo;t wait to see how this community grows in the future!</p>

<p>Cheers!<br />
James &amp; Jason<p />
