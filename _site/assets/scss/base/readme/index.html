<h1>Base</h1>
<p><code>/base/</code> is the <strong>simple foundation</strong> of your project that all other CSS builds on.  It supposes very little.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>It mostly consists of <code>reset.css</code> from <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">Eric Meyer</a>.</p>
<h3><code>_helpers.scss</code></h3>
<p><code>helpers</code> is a small collection of utility classes that can be added to HTML elements <strong>that do not already have a class</strong> if you need that element to do something in particular, like <code>float: right</code>.</p>
<p>But if the element already has a class, just add the rule to that class ruleset instead of using <code>@extend</code> or adding an additional class from <code>helpers</code> to the HTML element.</p>
<h3><code>_functions.scss</code></h3>
<p>This partial imports the partials in <code>/base/functions/</code>. New functions should be added to their own partials and imported / documented in this file.</p>
<h3><code>_mixins.scss</code></h3>
<p>This partial imports the partials in <code>/base/mixins/</code>. New mixins should be added to their own partials and imported / documented in this file.</p>
<h3><code>_extends.scss</code></h3>
<p>This partial imports the partials in <code>/base/extends/</code>. New extends should be added to their own partials and imported / documented in this file.</p>
<p><em>Note on <code>@extend</code></em> - try not to use this. If you do, expect to be pushed for a solid justification during your PR review.</p>
<h3><code>_variables.scss</code></h3>
<p>This partial imports the partials in <code>/base/variables/</code>. New variables should be added to the appropriate existing partial and new variable collections should be added to new partials, then imported / documented in this file.</p>
<h2>Additions</h2>
<p>If you have a function, mixin, or variable set that's valuable enough to to include in all the themes, <a href="https://github.com/fleetcreature/wp-starter/pulls">submit a PR</a>.</p>
